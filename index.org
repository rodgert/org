* We keep our configurations nice and tidy
** Most dot files are kept in a git repo in [[file:./../.dotfiles/index.org][~/.dotfiles]]
   symlinked into ~/ using GNU stow, ex.
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~ && stow -d .dotfiles foo
#+end_src
** Some dot files containing sekretz are kept in a git repo in [[file:./../.dot_private/index.org][~/.dot_private]]
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~ && stow -d .dot_private bar
#+end_src
** The configured environment includes -
*** git
    We keep git configuration private currently to avoid leaking user.email
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~ && stow -d .dot_private git
#+end_src
*** myrepos
    We use myrepos to manage all of our various git repos. We also keep this
    private.
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~ && stow -d .dot_private myrepos
#+end_src
